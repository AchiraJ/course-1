# Lab Number 1

In this lab the point is to get you thinking with a test mindset. What we have here is a simplistic KNN Regression tool. What you will do is take a look at regression.py and complete the tasks labeled with TODO.

# Environment

To get your environment running you will need Python 3.5.x (I've tested both). You will also have to install some packages:

```
pip install ipython pandas numpy scipy sklearn matplotlib
```

# To run the experiment

`jupyter notebook` and open up jupyter notebook and go through them there. The lab is in the sole ipynb here
